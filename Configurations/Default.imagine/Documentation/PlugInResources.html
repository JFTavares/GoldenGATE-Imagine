<h3><font face="Verdana">Plug-In Resources</font></h3>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">As opposed to the built-in resources, plug-in ones
are not vital for the GoldenGATE editor to be operational. Yet they can strongly
improve the functionality of the editor, e.g. providing markup automation and
thus reducing the manual effort for document markup. All resources in the
GoldenGATE editor are managed by&nbsp;<b>resoure providers</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">, which
provide and manage them. They all extend the abstract superclass&nbsp;</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">de.goldenGate.resourceManagement.ResourceManager</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">.
In order to create a new type of resources, write a new implementation of this
abstract class, pack it into a jar file along with auxilliary classes, and
deposit the jar in the Resources folder, which is a sub-folder of the GoldenGATE
main folder. GoldenGATE will automatically include the new resource provider at
the time of the next startup. The help pages for these plugged-in resources will
be integrated as subnodes of the node displaying this introduction page.</font></body>
