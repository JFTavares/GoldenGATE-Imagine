<h3><font face="Verdana">Built-In Resources</font></h3>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">The GoldenGATE editor has three built-in resource
types that are essential for its operability.</font>
<h4><font face="Verdana">Document Readers</font></h4>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Document Readers affect the behavior of the
GoldenGATE editor when loading a document. In marked-up data, they can filter
and rename tags, and decide if a tag will be represented as a Document Part or
as a plain Annotation.</font>
<h4><font face="Verdana">Document Writers</font></h4>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Document Writers affect the way the GoldenGATE
editor writes a document to disc. They allow filtering which Annotations are
written to disc, and which are not. This is useful for documents that contain a
lot of (maybe generic or intermediate) markup only a part of which are to be
written to the file, e.g. the elements of a particular XML namespace.</font>
<h4><font face="Verdana">Makros</font></h4>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Frequently used markup / editing sequences can be
bundeled to Makros, which makes them one-click accessible via custom buttons in
the Annotation Editor. A good example for a useful Makro is marking up the
selected text as a paragraph and subsequently applying the structural
normalization to the content of the newly created tag.</font></body>
