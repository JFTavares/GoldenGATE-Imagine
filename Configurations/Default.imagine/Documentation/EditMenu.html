<h3><font face="Verdana">The Edit Menu</font></h3>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Edit menu provides functions for editing XML
as well as textual content. This includes several operations for the automated
generation of structural markup.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Edit Selection</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Character wise edit the plain text currently
selected in the Annotation Editor. Since the Annotation Editor treats words as
atomic units in order to simplify manually creating XML markup, character wise
editing has to be done in a separate dialog. This function exists to avoid
switching to the Plain Text Editor for small corrections.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Find / Replace</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Do find / replace operations in the document
currently selected. This will automatically switch to the Plain Text Editor.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Annotate</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Create an Annotation (XML tag) enclosing the text
passage currently selected. Since the Annotation Editor treats words as atomic
units, the selection is automatically extended to match word borders.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Annotate All</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Create an Annotation (XML tag) enclosing every
occurence of the text passage currently selected in the current document. Since
the Annotation Editor treats words as atomic units, the selection is
automatically extended to match word borders. This function is primarily
intended for detail level markup (e.g. location or person names): Select the
particular name once, annotate all its occurences in the entire document with a
single click.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Create Document Part</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Create a Document Part (XML tag, special type of
Annotation) enclosing the text passage currently selected. Since the Annotation
Editor treats words as atomic units, the selection is automatically extended to
match word borders. Document Parts are editable individually, as if they were
entire documents on their own. This special type of Annotation is primarily
intended for structural markup. It allows, for instance, editing an individual
section of a document as if it was a document on its own.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Merge Annotations</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Merge neighbouring Annotations. Only Annotations
of the same type can be merged. This function is intended for joining paragraphs
that were errouniously split by OCR software, for instance. At least the end tag
of the first Annotation to be merged, and at least the start tag of the last one,
have to be selected for this function to work.</font><h4><font face="Verdana">Split
Annotation</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Split an Annotation into two. The inmost
Annotation enclosing the currently selected text is determined the target of
this operation. It is split at the word border before the selected text passage.
Exacly one word or punctuation mark has to be selected for this function to work.</font><h4><font face="Verdana">Rename
Annotations</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Rename Annotations, change their XML element name.</font><h4><font face="Verdana">Transform
Annotations</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Transform Annotations to Document Part so that
they gain the capabilities of the latter.</font><h4><font face="Verdana">Remove
Annotations</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Remove Annotations form the document. This
operation will only remove the tags, not the textual content of the Annotation.
To remove the latter as well, use Delete Annotations instead.</font><h4><font face="Verdana">Clear
Annotations</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Remove all Annotations from the current document.</font><h4><font face="Verdana">Delete
Annotations</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Delete Annotations, including their textual
content. To remove only the XML tags, use Remove Annotations instead.</font><h4><font face="Verdana">Rename
Annotation Attribute</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Rename an XML element attribute. This function can
be targeted at a particular type of Annotation, or at all Annotations.</font><h4><font face="Verdana">Remove
Annotation Attribute</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Remove an XML element attribute. This function can
be targeted at a particular type of Annotation, or at all Annotations. It can,
for instance, serve to remove alignment or other layout information from an HTML
document, without deleting the structure implied by the tags themselves.</font><h4><font face="Verdana">Clear
Annotation Attributes</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Remove all XML element attributes. This function
can be targeted at a particular type of Annotation, or at all Annotations.</font><h4><font face="Verdana">Split
Document</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Split the current document. Make each individual
Document Part of a particular type a document of its own. This function is
intended for, e.g., splitting up the chapters of a document.</font><h4><font face="Verdana">Annotate
Sentences</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Apply a built-in sentence splitter to the current
document. Sentences are marked with Annotations of the type &quot;sentence&quot;.</font><h4><font face="Verdana">Annotate
Paragraphs</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Apply a built-in paragraph splitter to the current
document. Paragraphs are marked with Document Parts of the type &quot;paragraph&quot;.</font><h4><font face="Verdana">Annotate
Sections</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Apply a built-in section splitter to the current
document. Sections are marked with Document Parts of the type &quot;section&quot;,
removing the section title from the text and making it an attribute of the
section tag.</font><h4><font face="Verdana">Normalize Paragraphs</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Apply a built-in paragraph normalizer to the
current document. The text within paragraph Annotations is &quot;normalized&quot;,
i.e. devided words are rejoined, and internal line breaks are converted into
spaces.</font>
<h4><font face="Verdana">Normalize Whitespace</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Apply a built-in whitespace normalizer to the
current document. This operation will remove, e.g., duplicate whitespaces and
whitespaces before closing brackets and after opening ones. While this sounds
sort of trivial, it is in fact pretty necessary to make the behavior of regular
expressions predictable while still keeping them somewhat at least managable.</font></body>
