<h3><font face="Verdana">Document Formats</font></h3>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Document Formats offer functionality for reading
and writing documents in arbitrary formats, such as XML, HTML, ARFF, and so on.
Some formats my be usable only for loading or only for saving documents. A
document format considering only those tags that are currently highlighted in
the Annotation Editor, for instance, is suited for saving a document in exactly
the layout that is currently visible, but is not appropriate for loading a
document. </font></body>
