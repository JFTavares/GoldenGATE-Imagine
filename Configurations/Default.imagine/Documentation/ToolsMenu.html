<h3><font face="Verdana">The Tools Menu</font></h3>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Tools menu gives instant access to all types
of resources provided by plug-ins rather than by the GoldenGATE editor itself.
Its items correspond to the &quot;Apply&quot; or &quot;Run&quot; entries in the
plug-in menus. If there are no plug-ins, this menu is not displayed.</font></body>
