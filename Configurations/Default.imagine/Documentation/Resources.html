<h3><font face="Verdana">Resources</font></h3>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">The functionality of the GoldenGATE editor can be
extended with <b>resources</b>. Beside general-purpose resources (like the
built-in Document Readers) providing an arbitrary type of functionality, there
arre two specialized resource types that are intended to provide additional
document editing functions (<b>Annotation sources</b> and <b>document processors</b>).
All resources in the GoldenGATE editor are managed by <b>resoure providers</b>. </font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Resource Providers</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Resource providers provide and manage
general-purpose resources, e.g. Document Readers. They all extend the abstract
superclass </font><font size="2" face="Courier New">de.goldenGate.resourceManagement.ResourceManager</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">.
In order to create a new type of resources, write a new implementation of this
abstract class, pack it into a jar file along with auxilliary classes, and
deposit the jar in the Resources folder, which is a sub-folder of the GoldenGATE
main folder. GoldenGATE will automatically include the new resource provider at
the time of the next startup.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Annotation Source Providers</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Annotation source providers manage and provide
Annotation sources. They extend an abstract subclass of </font><font size="2" face="Courier New">de.goldenGate.resourceManagement.ResourceManager</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">,
</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">de.goldenGate.resourceManagement.AnnotationSourceManager</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">.
Annotation sources are resources that create Annotations marking some parts of a
document. Whenever an Annotation source is applied, GoldenGATE will show the
newly created Annotations in a dialog for manual checking before they are added
to the document.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Document Processor Providers</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Document processor providers manage and provide
document processors. They extend an abstract subclass of </font><font size="2" face="Courier New">de.goldenGate.resourceManagement.ResourceManager</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">,
</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">de.goldenGate.resourceManagement.DocumentProcessorManager</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">.
Document processors are resources that can analyze and change a document in
whatever way they deem sensible. This includes creating, changing and removing
Annotations, and editing the document text. Spelling correction, for instance,
could be done by some appropriate document processor. Document processors are
capable of running autonomously, without user interaction, but can also interact
with the user by showing dialogs.</font></body>
