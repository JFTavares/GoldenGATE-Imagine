<h3><font face="Verdana">The File Menu</font></h3>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The File menu provides operations for opening,
saving, and closing files, and for closing the editor itself.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Open</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Open a file from the local file system via a
dialog. Checking the &quot;Use Custom Document Reader&quot; box allows manually
selecting the way GoldenGATE loads and parses the file content. See Document
Readers for further details on what GoldenGATE can do when loading a file.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Open URL</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Open a file from the internet via its URL. If the
URL contains no protocol, GoldenGATE assumes it to be HTTP. If the URL provides
no file extension or no file at all, GoldenGATE assumes the file to contain HTML.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Save</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Save the currently selected document to the local
file system. Checking the &quot;Use Custom Document Writer&quot; box allows
manually selecting the way GoldenGATE writes the file content (text and markup).
See Document Writers for further details on what GoldenGATE can do when saving a
document.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Save As</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Save the currently selected document to the local
file system with a different name. Checking the &quot;Use Custom Document Writer&quot;
box allows manually selecting the way GoldenGATE writes the file content (text
and markup). See Document Writers for further details on what GoldenGATE can do
when saving a document.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Save Parts As</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Save individual parts of the currently selected
document to the local file system. GoldenGATE will prompt for a file name, then
extending this name with &quot;.part1&quot;, &quot;.part2&quot;, and so on, for
the individual parts, plus the file extension. This allows, for instance, saving
the individual sections of a document as individual documents, thus breaking up
the original document to smaller units. Checking the &quot;Use Custom Document
Writer&quot; box allows manually selecting the way GoldenGATE writes the file
content (text and markup). See Document Writers for further details on what
GoldenGATE can do when saving a document.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Close</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Close the currently selected document. If it has
been modified since it was saved for the last time, GoldenGATE will prompt for
saving it.</font><h4><font face="Verdana">Close All</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Close all open documents. If one has been modified
since it was saved for the last time, GoldenGATE will prompt for saving it.</font><h4><font face="Verdana">Exit</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Exit the GoldenGATE document editor. This will
first close all open documents, then all open dependent windows, and finally the
editor main window itself.</font></body>
