<h3><font face="Verdana">The Annotation Editor</font></h3>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">The Annotation Editor is intended for handling the
document markup. Since almost all markup goes betweeen words, it treats words as
the atomic text units instead of individual characters. While this inhibits
character wise text editing, it greatly simplifies creating XML tags because
they are automatically placed at the word boundaries. An Annotation Editor has
five different parts:</font><h4><font face="Verdana">The Editor (center)</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">The editor is the core part of the Annotation
Editor. It displays the document text for markup editing, while the other parts
(see below) provide options to make the editing process more convenient. However,
the editor does not allow editing the text directly. All functions are based on
selecting a part of the text and subsequently applying some action to it. These
actions are accessible in several ways: Through the Edit menu of the main window,
through the button panel of the Annotation Editor (see below), or through the
context menu. The context menu is the only one of these ways that changes
depending on the current selection. In particular, there are three different
context menu states:</font>
<ul>
<li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Part of the text selected:</b> When a part
  of the text is selected, the context menu provides options for annotating it (<b>Annotate</b>,&nbsp;
  <b>Annotate All</b>,&nbsp;<b> Document Part</b>),
  including instant access to the most recently used annotation types. It also
  provides functions for splitting the surrounding Annotation (<b>Split
  Annotation</b>), or for
  merging Annotations at least on tag of which is part of the selecion (<b>Merge
  Annotations</b>). The last part of
  the context menu allows editing the words of the text. This comprises the
  following functions:</font>
  <ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Edit Tokens:</b> Character wise edit the
    plain text currently selected. This function exists to avoid switching to
    the Text Editor for small corrections.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Join Tokens:</b> Join the Tokens (i.e.
    words, numbers, punctuation) currently selected. While this results in
    subsequent words becoming one word, it will still split the text at clear
    word boundaries, e.g. before or after punctuation marks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Copy Tokens:</b> Copy the currently
    selected words to the clipbourd.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Cut Tokens:</b> Cut the currently
    selected words from the text and store them in the clipbourd.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Swap Clipboard:</b> Replace the currently
    selected words with the content of the clipboard, and move the replaced
    words to the clipboard.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Paste Tokens:</b> Replace the currently
    selected words with the content of the clipboard.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Delete Tokens:</b> Remove the selected
    words from the document.</font></li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Nothing selected, clicked on XML tag:</b> When
    opening the context menu on an XML tag, it provides funtions for opening the
    Annotation for direct editing (<b>Edit</b>), for removing it (<b>Remove</b>), and for
    transforming it to a Document Part (<b>Transform</b>). It also allows handling the
    content of the Annotation:</font>
      <ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Copy Tokens:</b> Copy the content of the
    Annotation to the clipbourd.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Cut Tokens:</b> Cut the content of the
    Annotation from the text and store them in the clipbourd. Since the
    Annotation itself is empty after this operation, it is removed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Delete Tokens:</b> Remove the content of
    the Annotation from the document. Since the Annotation itself is empty after
    this operation, it is removed.</font></li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Nothing selected:</b> When
    opening the context menu in the text with nothing selected, it allows
    pasting the content of the clipboard at this location (<b>Paste Tokens</b>).</font>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4><font face="Verdana">The Button Panel (top)</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">The button panel is another way to access the most
common functions of the Annotation Editor. In particular, it provides the basic
functions for handeling Annotations:</font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Edit Selection:</b> Character wise edit the plain text currently selected in the Annotation Editor. This function exists to avoid switching to the Plain Text Editor for small
    corrections.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Annotate:</b> Create an Annotation (XML tag) enclosing the text passage currently selected.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Annotate All:</b> Create an Annotation (XML tag) enclosing every occurence of the text passage currently selected in the current document.
    This function is primarily intended for detail level markup (e.g. location or person names): Select the particular name once, annotate all its occurences in the entire document with a single
    click.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Mark Document Part:</b> Create a Document Part (XML tag, special type of Annotation) enclosing the text passage currently selected.
    This special type of Annotation is primarily intended for structural markup. It allows, for instance, editing an individual section of a document as if it was a document on its
    own.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Merge Annotations:</b> Merge neighbouring Annotations. Only Annotations of the same type can be merged.
    At least the end tag of the first Annotation to be merged, and at least the start tag of the last one, have to be selected for this function to
    work.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Split Annotation:</b> Split an Annotation into two. The inmost Annotation enclosing the currently selected text is determined the target of this operation. It is split at the word border before the selected text passage. Exacly one word or punctuation mark has to be selected for this function to
    work.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Edit Fonts:</b> Edit the displaying font, font size, and color of the document currently selected. These settings are independent for textual content and XML tags. This is in favor of making content easier to distinguish from markup. The default values for these settings are accessible through Preferences in the Window
    menu.</font></li>
</ul>

<h4><font face="Verdana">The Recent Action Panel (upper-left)</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">The recent action panel allows instantly repeating
the most recently used actions, reusing the original parameters. This avoids,
for instance, re-entering the Annotation type / XML element name when creating a
new Annotation.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">The Makro Panel (lower-left)</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">The makro panel provides access to Makros. A Makro
consists of a an XML element name to annnotate selected text with, and some
resource that is automatically applied to the newly created Annotation.
Frequently used markup / editing sequences can be bundeled this way, making them
one-click accessible. A good example for a useful Makro is marking up the
selected text as a paragraph and subsequently applying the structural
normalization to the content of the newly created tag.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">The Layout Panel (right)</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">The layout panel allows showing / hiding the
individual XML element tags contained in the document, and highlighting the tag
content. This is in favor of clarity, e.g. for hiding detail level markup when
working on the document structure. The left of the two checkboxes highlights the
Annotation content, while the right one shows / hides the respective XML tags. A
click on the XML element name / Annotation type will open a dialog for adjusting
the color used for this type of Annotation.</font>
