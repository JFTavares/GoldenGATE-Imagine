<h3><font face="Verdana">The Window Menu</font></h3>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Window menu allows editing the configurartion
of the GoldenGATE editor. This includes access to some built-in resources.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Preferences</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Edit the global settings of the GoldenGATE editor.
In particular, these are:</font>
<ul>
<li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Annotation Editor Default Settings:</b>&nbsp;The
  upper part of the preferences affect the default settings for the Annotation
  Editor. In particular there are:</font><ul>
<li><font face="Verdana" size="2">The font style, size, and color for the textual content</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana" size="2">The font style, size, and color for the XML tags</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana" size="2">The behavior of the Annotation Editor when new Annotations or Document Parts
  are created. Both can be highlighted with a colored background and / or
  surrounded by newly created tags. While the former is convenient for detail
  level tags (usually Annotations), the latter would disrupt the optical text
  structure in most cases. For structural markup (usually Document Part), it is
  just the other way round. Depending on the use case, however, other
  configurations may be more convenient.</font></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Global Settings:</b>&nbsp;The initial and
  maximum memory for the Java Virtual Machine the GoldenGATE editor runs in.
  Since these settings are arguments to the Java Virtual Machine, changes to
  them will take a restart of the editor to have any effect.</font></li>
</ul>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Document Readers</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Document Readers affect the behavior of the
GoldenGATE editor when loading a document. In marked-up data, they can filter
and rename tags, and decide if a tag will be represented as a Document Part or
as a plain Annotation.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Document Writers</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Document Writers affect the way the GoldenGATE
editor writes a document to disc. They allow filtering which Annotations are
written to disc, and which are not. This is useful for documents that contain a
lot of (maybe generic or intermediate) markup only a part of which are to be
written to the file, e.g. the elements of a particular XML namespace.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Makros</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Frequently used markup / editing sequences can be
bundeled to Makros, which makes them one-click accessible via custom buttons in
the Annotation Editor. A good example for a useful Makro is marking up the
selected text as a paragraph and subsequently applying the structural
normalization to the content of the newly created tag.</font></body>
