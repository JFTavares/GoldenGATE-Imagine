<h3><font face="Verdana">The Document Editor</font></h3>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Each Document Editor holds an open document. They
are managed as tabs in the main window of the GoldenGATE editor. A Document
Editor has three sub-editors which serve different purposes:</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">The Annotation Editor</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">The Annotation Editor is intended for handling the
document markup. Since almost all markup goes betweeen words, it treats words as
the atomic text units instead of individual characters. While this inhibits
character wise text editing, it greatly simplifies creating XML tags because
they are automatically placed at the word boundaries.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">The Text Editor</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">The Text Editor serves for character wise
editing, e.g. Find / Replace operations or manual spelling correction. In order
to provide a concise and clean view on the textual content, the Text
Editor displays no markup, but only the plain text.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">The Plain XML Preview</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">The Plain XML Preview displays a document as
nicely formatted and indented XML in a view-only fashion.</font></body>
