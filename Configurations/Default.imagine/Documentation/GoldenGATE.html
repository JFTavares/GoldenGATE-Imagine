<h3><font face="Verdana">The GoldenGATE Document Editor</font></h3>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
Welcome to the GoldenGATE document editor, a new flavor of XML editing.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Purpose</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
The GoldenGATE document editor is intended for the creation of new XML content from plain text data,
and for inserting additional markup to document centric XML documents in order
to make them more data centric and machine readable.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Approach</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
The idea of the GoldenGATE document editor is to support a user in creating XML markup as far as possible. This
comprises automation support for manual editing of XML as well as fully
automated creation of markup. The latter includes, for instance, the application
of natural language processing (NLP) algorithms.</font>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Key Features</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
The key features of the GoldenGATE document editor are:</font>
<ul>
<li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>XML Editing:</b>&nbsp;Editing XML data in a flexible environment. In favor of lucidity, individual XML elements can be hidden and shown so that only those tags are visible which are important for the particular editing operation in progress. This editing mode treats words as the atomic text units rather than individual characters. Since XML tags are highly likely to go between words, this facilitates the selection-based creation of markup by far. In addition, users can configure frequently used actions to become one-click accessible.</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Text Editing:</b>&nbsp;Editing the content as plain text. Again in favor of lucidity, GoldenGATE provides a text editing mode that displays the content as plain text, which makes the data way easier to edit because there are no tags needing to be paid attention to.</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Markup Conversion:</b>&nbsp;Rule based conversion and transformation of markup. As opposed to other XML editors, GoldenGATE does not apply XSLT or similar standards. It uses some very simple conversions which are easily configured and managed, but still are powerful enough to handle common conversions.</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Native NLP:</b>&nbsp;Application of gazetteers and regular expressions. The GoldenGATE editor natively provides components that allow handling and applying gazetteers and regular expressions for automatically creating fine-grained markup.</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Extensibility:</b>&nbsp;Straightforward integration of additional functionality. The GoldenGATE editor can include several types of plugin components that serve a variety of purposes. The modules for gazetteers and regular expressions, for instance, are handled this way, although they are provided as part of the native functionalities.</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Operation Sequencing:</b>&nbsp;Bundeling of frequently editing step sequences. The GoldenGATE editor allows bundeling frequently applied sequences of editing steps, which makes them accessible as one.</font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Batch Mode:</b>&nbsp;Autonomously processing a set of files. The GoldenGATE editor is capable of autonomously processing documents, e.g. doing some markup transformations to an entire folder of files in an overnight job.</font></li>
</ul>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Enjoy</font></h4>
